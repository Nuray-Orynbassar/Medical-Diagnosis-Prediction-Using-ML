# Medical-Diagnosis-Prediction-Using-ML
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for binary classification on a medical diagnosis dataset stored in MongoDB.
- Data extraction and cleaning from MongoDB
- EDA and visualization
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and confusion matrix
- Comparative analysis of regularization techniques (L1 vs L2)
- Visualization of feature importance and model performance
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, MongoDB
  **Key Results:**
  Best-performing model: SVM (RBF) with Accuracy 97.37%, F1-score 0.96, AUC 0.9944
  Demonstrated ROC curve comparison and feature importance visualization
